TEMPLATE LITERALS (TEMPLATE STRINGS) :

 * To create template strings, we use two backticks.
   We can insert data as expressions into a template string.
   To insert data, we enclose the expression in curly braces "{}" and start it with a dollar sign $.

 * let a = 2
   let b = 3
   console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`)

 * let a = 2
   let b = 2
   console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b} : ${a > b}`) // 2 is greater than 3 : false
