VARIABLES :

 * Variables can be thought of as data containers. It's important to remember that variables store data in memory (RAM). When a variable is assigned, memory space is allocated for it. When a value (data) is assigned to a variable, that memory space is filled with the data. We use the 'var,' 'let,' or 'const' keywords to declare variables.

 * We use 'let' when the variable's value needs to be changed in different parts of our code. If the variable's     value won't change anywhere, we use 'const.'

 * A valid JavaScript variable name must adhere to the following rules:

  - It does not start with a number.
  - It does not contain special characters except for the dollar sign and underscore.
  - It follows the camelCase convention.
  - There are no spaces between words.





 EXAMPLES OF VARIABLE DECLARATIONS:


 * let firstName = 'Barbaros';

 * let lastName = 'Göçmen';

 * let age = 23;

 * let isMarried = false;

  - console.log(firstName, lastName, age, isMarried); // Outputs: Barbaros Göçmen 23 false



 * const gravity = 9.81;

 * const pi = 3.14;

 * let name = 'BarbarosGöçmen',
  job = 'Developer',
  location = 'Istanbul';

  - console.log(name, job, location); // Outputs: BarbarosGöçmen Developer Istanbul
